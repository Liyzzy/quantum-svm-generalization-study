# quantum-svm-generalization-study
This project investigates the performance and generalization capabilities of Quantum Support Vector Machines (QSVM) versus Classical SVM in binary classification tasks. Implemented using Qiskit on simulated quantum backends (Qiskit Aer) and compared with traditional SVMs in scikit-learn, the study evaluates two datasets Spambase and Lung Cancer.
