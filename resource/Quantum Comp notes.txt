CLASSICAL VS QUANTUM

Classical Computers store bits one at a time
Quantum store qubit = quantum bits 
Think qubits are like arrow in 3D space, if they point up theyre in zero state and down for 1
Can be superpositon that is combination of 0 or 1

Need to understand 3 things in quantum
- Superposition
- Entanglement
- Interference

Superposition
- Combination of 0 or 1
- They output also is either zero or 1 BUT
- Which one we get is based on a probability by direction of arrow. 50% 1 , 50% 2

Entanglement
- In classical computers, the state of 1 bit is not being influenced by another bit
- But its different for quantum computers
- Qubits are entangled by each other where they can be part of one quantum state together
- See the percentage then calculate the probability distribution
- Because it is entangled, changing the arrows of either one qubit will effect the probability distribution.
- Therefore qubits are not independent

Inteference 
- Qubit explains Quantum Wavefunctions
- How many qubits means the same for how many wavefunctions, we add them up then we have an
overall wavefunction
- Mcm physics dulu, constructive and destructive wavefunctions
- When we want to get output here is what to consider
  We need to increase the constructive to get the highest probability of answer being correct
  And decrease the destructive function to get the lowest probability of having incorrect

To do all the process of wavelengths mentioned, we use Quantum Algorithms

[Quantum Algorithms]

1. Shor's algorithm
- If we got two big numbers to multiply lets say 7177 x 3001, we have a fast classical algo to solve the problem
- But if we start with the answer and need to find what are the original numbers that multiply together to make this number, is very a lot difficult (Factors)
- This is because the search base of possible factors is so large
- No efficient classical algorithm to solve
- Shor algo solves this
- Shors algo is polynomial log(N)
- Best algorithm to solve problem gets bigger is exponential
- But shors algorithm is polynomial 

Complexity Theory
- How much harder it is to solve the problem as the problem gets larger
