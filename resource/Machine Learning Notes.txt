Kernel in Machine Learning
- straightforward function that operates on two vectors from the input space
- The primary role of this function is to return a scalar value, but the fascinating aspect of this process lies in what this scalar represents and how it is computed
- This scalar is, in essence, the dot product of the two input vectors
- Mapping function helps this by converting 2D coord to 3D coordinates
- However, there are many disadvantages with this process
- It involves more computational cost and learning cost

Hyperplane
- Separates feature space into distinct regions each corresponds to their class.
- Basically the decision boundary
